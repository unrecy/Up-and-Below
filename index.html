    Above and Below is an interactive media narrative with the aim of raising awareness about the preservation of the oceans with a particular focus on the effects that micro plastics have on ocean life and its consequences on the human world as well.
    <br/><br/>
    Above and Below is set in two mirrored worlds: Aurum (Above) and Staghorn (Below) separated by a body of water. We follow the story of Poppy, a woman from Staghorn who has to find a cure for her friend, getting sick because of the toxicity present in their world. She will encounter many different characters during her mission, coming from both above and below.
